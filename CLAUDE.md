# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Magellai is a command-line interface (CLI) tool and REPL that interacts with Large Language Models (LLMs). It operates in two primary modes:
- **`ask` mode**: One-shot queries
- **`chat` mode**: Interactive conversations (REPL)

The project follows a library-first design where the core intelligence (LLM providers, prompt orchestration, tools, agents, workflows) is implemented as a reusable Go module.

  âœ… Phase 4.4: REPL Integration with Unified Command System - Complete
    âœ… Route REPL commands through command registry
    âœ… Support both `/` and `:` command prefixes
    âœ… Integrate with existing core commands
    âœ… Maintain command history across modes
    âœ… Support command aliases in REPL
    âœ… Context preservation between commands
  âœ… Phase 4.5: REPL UI Enhancements - Complete
    âœ… Tab completion for commands - Complete
    âœ… ANSI color output when TTY - Complete (including library refactoring)
    âœ… Non-interactive mode detection - Complete
    âœ… scan and fix Context preservation between commands - Complete
  âœ… Phase 4.6: Fix domain layer and types - Complete
    âœ… Domain package structure created
    âœ… All core domain types implemented
    âœ… Storage package refactored to use domain types
    âœ… REPL package refactored to use domain types
    âœ… LLM package updated with domain adapters
    âœ… All tests updated and passing
    âœ… Build and lint checks passing
  âœ… Phase 4.7: Fix tests, test-integration issue - Complete
    âœ… Fixed logging tests that were failing in bulk runs
    âœ… Fixed session export tests creating leftover files
    âœ… All unit and integration tests passing
  ðŸš§ Phase 4.8: Configuration - defaults, sample etc. - In Progress
    - [ ] with no configuration file, use a default configuration
    - [ ] add a flag or command to create an example configuration
    - [ ] show config should show all current runtime configurations
  ðŸ”² Phase 4.9: Code abstraction and redundancy checks - Pending (REVISIT)
  ðŸ”² Phase 4.10: Documentation and architecture updates - Pending (REVISIT)
  ðŸ”² Phase 4.11: Final validation and rollout - Pending (REVISIT)

## Development Conventions

- **Workflow Task Completion**: 
  - Run full `make`, `make test`, `make test-integration`, `make lint` after every task completion
