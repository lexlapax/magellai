# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Magellai is a command-line interface (CLI) tool and REPL that interacts with Large Language Models (LLMs). It operates in two primary modes:
- **`ask` mode**: One-shot queries
- **`chat` mode**: Interactive conversations (REPL)

The project follows a library-first design where the core intelligence (LLM providers, prompt orchestration, tools, agents, workflows) is implemented as a reusable Go module.

## Development Conventions

- **Workflow Task Completion**: 
  - Run full `make`, `make test`, `make test-integration`, `make lint` after every task completion

### Development Memories

- I'll do git actions myself
