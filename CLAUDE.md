# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Magellai is a command-line interface (CLI) tool and REPL that interacts with Large Language Models (LLMs). It operates in two primary modes:
- **`ask` mode**: One-shot queries
- **`chat` mode**: Interactive conversations (REPL)

The project follows a library-first design where the core intelligence (LLM providers, prompt orchestration, tools, agents, workflows) is implemented as a reusable Go module.

  ðŸ”² Phase 4.4: REPL Integration with Unified Command System - Pending
  ðŸ”² Phase 4.5: REPL UI Enhancements - Pending
  âœ… Phase 4.6: Fix domain layer and types - Complete
    âœ… Domain package structure created
    âœ… All core domain types implemented
    âœ… Storage package refactored to use domain types
    âœ… REPL package refactored to use domain types
    âœ… LLM package updated with domain adapters
    âœ… All tests updated and passing
    âœ… Build and lint checks passing
  âœ… Phase 4.7: Fix tests, test-integration issue - Complete
    âœ… Fixed logging tests that were failing in bulk runs
    âœ… Fixed session export tests creating leftover files
    âœ… All unit and integration tests passing
  ðŸš§ Phase 4.8: Run code, abstraction, redundancy checks and fixes - Next
  ðŸ”² Phase 4.9: Documentation and architecture updates - Pending (moved from 4.6)
  ðŸ”² Phase 4.10: Final validation and rollout - Pending (moved from 4.6)

## Development Conventions

- **Workflow Task Completion**: 
  - Run full `make`, `make test`, `make test-integration`, `make lint` after every task completion
