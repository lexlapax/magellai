# Design Patterns for an LLM-Driven CLI and REPL Client

## Introduction

`magellai` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool and REPL (read-eval-print loop) that interacts with Large Language Models (LLMs) and modular agents/tools via APIs. It operates in two primary modes: an **`ask` mode** for one-shot queries and a **`chat` mode** for interactive conversations. The CLI supports Unix-style pipelines and PowerShell, allowing usage like:

* `magellai ask "Write me a poem about the sea."` (one-shot command)
* `magellai chat` (enter interactive chat session REPL)
* `cat README.md | magellai ask "Summarize the following."` (pipeline input)

The design must accommodate hierarchical subcommands (e.g. `magellai tool ...`, `magellai agent ...`, `magellai flow ...`, `magellai config ...`), extensibility via plugins/workflows (e.g. `magellai agent researcher`, `magellai tool calculator`, `magellai flow deep-research`), and various flags for runtime behavior (`--verbosity`, `--stream`, `--output=json`, `--model`, etc.). It should also handle file attachments (`-a <file>`) and produce outputs in multiple formats (plain text, Markdown, JSON, images, etc.), defaulting to human-readable text. This report surveys relevant design paradigms from modern CLI tools, examines how to split functionality between CLI and REPL modes, and outlines best practices for discoverability, flag design, plugin architecture, and consistent UX patterns.

## Lessons from Advanced CLI Tools

Modern CLI tools like **Git, kubectl, gh,** and **az** demonstrate robust paradigms for structuring commands and subcommands. They typically follow a **hierarchical command** design with a base command and multiple subcommands. For example, Git’s syntax is `git <subcommand>` (e.g. `git commit`, `git push`), and Kubernetes’ CLI is `kubectl <verb> <resource>` (e.g. `kubectl get pods`). This structure helps organize functionality and makes the CLI scalable. Key patterns include:

* **Built-in and External Subcommands:** Git and kubectl both allow extension via external executables. The Git client acts as a wrapper that dispatches to subcommand executables: when you run `git foo`, it searches the Git exec path or system `$PATH` for an executable named `git-foo` and runs it. Similarly, kubectl recognizes any `kubectl-<name>` binary on the PATH as a plugin command `kubectl <name>`. This pattern means new capabilities can be added without changing the core binary – for `magellai`, adopting a similar convention (`magellai-<ext>`) would enable community or third-party plugins to introduce new subcommands (e.g. a plugin `magellai-research` providing `magellai research`). Tools like **GitHub’s CLI (gh)** and **Azure CLI (az)** formalize this: GitHub CLI 2.0 introduced **extensions** where any repository named with a `gh-<name>` prefix can be installed as a new `gh <name>` command. Azure CLI, being implemented in Python, allows installing **extension packages** (Python wheels) that add commands to the CLI’s command tree.

* **Consistent Command Structure:** Successful CLIs enforce consistent syntax patterns. For instance, Azure CLI and kubectl use a **noun-verb** pattern (`az group create`, `kubectl delete deployment`), whereas Git uses a **verb (subcommand) + object** pattern (`git commit <file>`). The key is to not mix styles arbitrarily. In `magellai`’s context, top-level modes like `ask` and `chat` are verbs (actions), while other subcommands like `tool`, `agent`, `flow`, `config` are nouns that likely contain their own verbs or sub-commands (e.g. `magellai config set api_key ...`). It’s important to maintain clarity: for example, if `tool` is a namespace for managing or running tools, one might use `magellai tool list` (verb = list) and `magellai tool run <toolName>` instead of just `magellai tool <name>`. Adopting a clear convention (all top-level commands as primary actions, with secondary noun qualifiers, or vice-versa) will make the CLI intuitive.

* **Help as a First-Class Feature:** Advanced CLIs provide comprehensive help at every level of command hierarchy, aiding discoverability. Typing a base command with no arguments usually shows a summary of usage. For example, running `jq` with no arguments prints a brief description and an example, then directs the user to `jq --help` for details. Likewise, best practice is for `magellai` to display helpful info if invoked without proper arguments or with `-h/--help`. Each subcommand (`magellai agent --help`, `magellai tool --help`, etc.) should detail its purpose, flags, and sub-subcommands. A **help tree** that users can navigate (similar to `git help <subcommand>`) is useful in complex CLIs. Ensuring consistency (e.g. always using `-h/--help` for help and making it available even after other args) is recommended.

* **Examples and Guides:** Command help sections and documentation should include usage examples. Many CLIs (Git, kubectl, Azure) include example invocations in their help text to demonstrate common use cases. This lowers the learning curve, especially for multi-part commands. `magellai` can follow suit by providing sample commands for, say, how to attach a file in a question or how to pipe input from a file.

* **Auto-Completion:** Tools like Git, kubectl, AWS CLI, etc., offer shell completion scripts that help users discover subcommands and flags by pressing Tab. Providing **tab-completion** for `magellai` (for Bash, Zsh, PowerShell, etc.) will significantly improve usability. For instance, as a user types `magellai ag<Tab>`, the shell could suggest `agent` or `ask`, and further subcommands thereafter. PowerShell, being object-oriented, can also support completions and even dynamic parameter suggestions. Ensuring that the CLI has a completion script or built-in completion (if using a framework that supports it) is a best practice for advanced tools. This makes even deeply nested commands discoverable without constantly referring to docs.

## CLI vs REPL: One-shot Commands and Interactive Mode

Because `magellai` has both a CLI mode (`ask`) and a REPL mode (`chat`), it’s important to delineate which commands and behaviors belong in each, and how they overlap:

* **One-shot CLI Commands (`ask` and others):** These are non-interactive invocations that take input (prompt and any attachments) and produce a single output before exiting. They work well for scripting and pipelines. For example, `magellai ask "Translate to French" -a text.txt --model=gpt-4` could read the content of `text.txt` (via the attachment flag) and output the translation, then terminate. Other subcommands like running a specific tool or flow can also be one-shot: e.g. `magellai flow deep-research -a topic.md` might execute a predefined research workflow on the given topic file and return results. CLI commands are stateless in the sense that each invocation is independent (though they might record history or use config). They should be designed to accept all necessary input via arguments, flags, or STDIN, since there's no ongoing session. According to CLI guidelines, a program should never force interactive prompts when data is piped or flags are provided – it should treat non-interactive stdin as input rather than trigger an interactive prompt. `magellai ask` should therefore allow something like `echo "Hello" | magellai ask` to treat `"Hello"` as the prompt if no prompt argument was given, ensuring it behaves nicely in pipelines.

* **Interactive REPL (`chat` mode):** This mode maintains state across multiple turns of conversation with the LLM. Upon running `magellai chat`, the user would enter an interactive prompt (much like a Python or SQL REPL, or ChatGPT in the terminal). In this mode, certain commands or meta-commands make sense to manage the session. For example, **Open Interpreter** (an AI CLI tool) implements special “magic” commands prefixed with `%` to control the session without confusing the LLM. They have commands like `%reset` (reset the session context), `%undo` (remove the last message), `%info` (show system info), and so on. `magellai` could adopt a similar approach (or use a different prefix like `:` or `\` or a dedicated syntax) for internal commands in chat mode – e.g. typing `/exit` to quit, `/history` to list past interactions, `/model gpt-4` to switch the model mid-chat, etc. The design should clearly distinguish user messages to the LLM versus control commands.

* **Shared and Exclusive Commands:** Some commands are relevant in both CLI and REPL contexts, while others are exclusive to one. **Content-related actions** (asking questions, running tools/agents) are needed in both modes. For instance, you might use `magellai ask` for a one-off question, but in REPL you just type the question and hit enter – functionally the same query happens within the session. On the other hand, **session management** (like saving conversation, changing the LLM model on the fly, or listing available plugins) might be exclusively REPL commands or have different form in CLI. A command like `magellai history` (to show previous sessions or queries) could be implemented in two ways: as a standalone CLI command (`magellai history list` perhaps) and as an interactive command inside chat (`/history`). It’s wise to keep these consistent in naming and effect if both exist. For example, `magellai history` on the CLI might list session IDs and summaries, and in the REPL, `/history` could do the same or even open an interactive picker. Indeed, Open Interpreter’s terminal mode saves conversations and allows resuming them via a flag (`--conversations`) that opens a chooser. `magellai` might similarly support something like `magellai chat --resume <sessionID>` or an interactive selection of past sessions.

* **Context Carryover:** In REPL mode, the prompt and LLM have conversational memory (within the limits of context length). In CLI one-shot mode, each call is independent. This means certain flags or behaviors differ: e.g., a `--temperature` flag in CLI applies to that one answer, whereas in REPL it might persist for the session unless changed. A design decision is whether to allow changing generation parameters mid-chat (perhaps via a special command) or require starting a new session for different parameters. Open Interpreter notes that running a new `interpreter` session doesn’t remember previous conversations by default, which is analogous to `magellai ask` always being a fresh context. For consistency, `magellai chat` could start fresh unless told to resume a saved session. Documentation should clarify these differences to users (for example: *"`ask` mode does not remember history; use `chat` for follow-ups or multi-turn conversations."*).

* **Stateful Agents and Tools:** If `magellai` supports launching an autonomous agent (e.g. `magellai agent researcher` that might perform a series of actions), consider whether that runs to completion and exits (probably CLI one-shot style), or whether it enters its own interactive loop. A “researcher” agent might internally produce a report after doing a chain of prompts; that could be done with one command that streams output. In contrast, a simpler tool like `magellai tool calculator "2+2"` should just print `4` and exit. Generally, if an operation can finish without user interaction, it should be a normal CLI command. Reserve REPL primarily for human-LLM interactive chatting or for long-lived sessions where continuous user guidance is needed.

In summary, **design CLI commands for atomic, scriptable operations and REPL commands for interactive control and dialog.** Ensure that for any functionality present in both, the naming and behavior are aligned (perhaps with slight differences in invocation). This dual-mode design gives users flexibility: automation via CLI and exploration via REPL.

## Discoverability and User Experience

A powerful CLI can offer many features, but it must remain discoverable and user-friendly. Patterns from popular CLIs can inform `magellai`’s UX:

* **Hierarchical Help and Onboarding:** As mentioned, comprehensive help text is crucial. When users type `magellai help` or even just `magellai` alone, the tool should respond with a concise overview: a description of the tool, its primary modes (`ask`, `chat`, etc.), and a few common examples. For instance, it might show:

  ```text
  magellai - LLM-powered assistant CLI and chat tool

  Usage:
    magellai ask "<question>" [flags]    Ask a one-time question to the AI
    magellai chat [options]              Start an interactive chat session
    magellai tool <tool-name> [args]     Run or manage a specific tool
    magellai agent <agent-name> [args]   Run a specialized multi-step agent
    magellai flow <flow-name> [args]     Execute a predefined workflow
    magellai config <subcommand> [...]   Configuration management
    magellai history [subcommand]       View or manage past sessions/history
    
  For detailed help on each command, run 'magellai <command> --help'
  ```

  This illustrates a possible help summary. Each primary subcommand then can have its own help with more specifics and examples. **Interactive onboarding** could also be considered: for example, the first time a user runs `magellai chat`, it might print a brief welcome message with a tip (e.g. “Type your questions to converse with the AI. Type `/help` for special commands.”). Some CLIs like Azure’s have a dedicated interactive mode that guides usage with inline descriptions as you type. While `magellai`’s domain is different, a guided first-run or an explicit `magellai tutorial` command could help new users explore features.

* **Tab Completion and Suggestions:** As noted, shell completion significantly aids discovery. `magellai` should provide autocompletion not only for commands but also for flags and perhaps common values (like model names if feasible). For example, after `magellai --model <Tab>` it could suggest known model identifiers (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, etc.) if the completion script is advanced. This transforms the UX by allowing users to find available subcommands (like after typing `magellai tool <Tab>` it lists installed tool plugins). Many CLI frameworks (Click for Python, Cobra for Go, etc.) can auto-generate completion scripts. Ensuring these are distributed or easy to set up (maybe `magellai setup-completion`) will improve the user experience and reduce the need to memorize commands.

* **Error Messages and Guidance:** A discoverable CLI also guides the user when things go wrong. For example, if a user typos a subcommand (`magellai agnt`), the tool could detect the unknown command and respond with a suggestion: “Unrecognized command 'agnt'. Did you mean 'agent'?” This kind of friendly error handling is seen in tools like git (which might say “git: 'cmomit' is not a git command. See 'git --help'. Did you mean 'commit'?”). Implementing suggestions (perhaps using Levenshtein distance on command names) can save user frustration. When a subcommand is correct but usage is wrong, printing a short usage hint or directing to `--help` is better than a cryptic error. Always **showing next steps** is key: e.g. “Missing argument <prompt>. Usage: magellai ask "<your question>". See 'magellai ask --help' for more.”.

* **Inline Help in REPL:** For interactive sessions, consider a built-in help command. For instance, typing `%help` or `/help` in `magellai chat` could list the special REPL commands or shortcuts available, without leaving the session. This ensures users can discover meta-commands (like `/exit`, `/reset`, etc.) on the fly.

* **Formatting and Readability:** Since output can be verbose (LLM responses, multi-step reasoning, etc.), format the output for readability. Keep paragraphs of text responses reasonably sized, and possibly use Markdown formatting (which the CLI can just pass through) for headings or lists in answers. For status messages or tool outputs, **terminal text styling** can help – for example, using colors to distinguish the AI’s response, tool execution logs, errors, or system messages. Many modern CLIs use color and even emoji sparingly to make outputs clearer. For instance, a success message might be green or prefixed with a check mark, while errors are red. `magellai` could style its own prompts or prefixes (perhaps prefix AI responses with a colorized name like “AI: …”). If implementing streaming output (`--stream`), a spinner or progress indicator for the streaming response could improve UX (akin to a typing indicator).

* **Use of Tables and Alignment:** When displaying lists (like `magellai tool list` showing available tools, or `magellai history` listing sessions), present them in a clean table format with columns (using fixed-width or Unicode box drawing characters) so that information is easy to scan. For example:

  ```
  ID   Type       Description
  1    Tool       Calculator tool for basic math
  2    Agent      "Researcher" agent for multi-step web research
  3    Flow       "deep-research" workflow automating literature review
  ```

  Organized output allows users to quickly identify what’s available. As Emily Goldfein notes in CLI design tips, grouping information and using tables can help users absorb content faster.

* **Contextual Examples:** Some CLIs provide context-aware help. Azure CLI’s interactive mode will show parameter descriptions and even auto-suggest required flags as you type. While implementing a full interactive guide may be complex, `magellai` could at least ensure that `--help` outputs include **realistic examples** for how AI-related commands work (e.g., how to attach multiple files, or how to request JSON output from a model). This is especially useful for features users might not guess (like attachments or less common flags).

By following these patterns – rich help text, completions, friendly errors, and clear output formatting – `magellai` can be approachable despite its advanced capabilities. A user should never feel “lost” in the interface; at any point, `magellai` should be ready to explain what commands exist and how to use them.

## Flags and Options: Runtime vs Content Modifiers

Designing flags (options) for a CLI involves balancing simplicity with flexibility. `magellai` will likely have a variety of flags: some that affect *how* the program runs or connects to LLM services, and others that affect *what* the AI produces or how results are formatted. Best practices for flag design include:

* **Follow Conventional Names and Formats:** Use standard flag names where applicable so users can guess them. For instance, `-h/--help` for help, `--version` for version info, `-v` often for verbose (or verbosity), `-q` for quiet, etc. Many CLI conventions have emerged (like `--output` for specifying output format, `-o` as a short version) – sticking to these means users don’t have to learn a new vocabulary. For flags that are unique to the domain (e.g. `--model` or `--temperature` for LLM), ensure the naming is clear and consistent (perhaps no short alias if not needed, or use `-m` for model as it’s common in AI circles).

* **Global vs Local Flags:** Determine which flags apply globally to the program versus those specific to subcommands. In Git or kubectl, some flags can be placed *before or after* the subcommand and they still work (e.g. `kubectl -n namespace get pods` vs `kubectl get pods -n namespace`). These global flags (like specifying config file, verbosity, etc.) are accepted in many contexts. If `magellai` has global settings (like `--verbosity`, `--output`, `--no-stream`), consider supporting them on all relevant commands for consistency. Kubectl’s design, for example, is such that basic configuration flags like `--context` or `--namespace` are supported on any command that needs them. However, be cautious not to make flag parsing overly complex – clear separation in help text of “global options” vs “command-specific options” can help avoid confusion.

* **Runtime-Modifying vs Content-Affecting Flags:** This is a crucial distinction:

  * *Runtime-modifying flags* influence how the CLI or underlying API operates, but not the semantic content of the request. Examples: `--model` (chooses which model or provider to query), `--temperature` (sets randomness of the LLM responses), `--max-tokens` (limits length), `--timeout`, `--no-stream` (disable streaming, meaning wait for full output), `--api-key` or `--profile` (which credentials/config to use). These flags affect performance, cost, speed, or selection of AI backend but the user’s question/request remains the same.
  * *Content-affecting flags* influence the format or nature of the output content. For instance, `--output=json` might instruct the CLI to format the final output as JSON (or instruct the LLM to respond in JSON). `--stream` actually might be considered runtime (streaming vs not), but it changes the user experience of output delivery. Another content flag could be something like `--markdown` (if you want to force or interpret output as Markdown), or `--no-format` (to strip any ANSI formatting), etc. Attachments (`-a file`) also fall in this category as they modify the content fed into the LLM (they provide additional context).

  It’s best practice to **separate these conceptually and in documentation**. For example, in help or docs, group “Model and generation parameters” flags separately from “Output formatting” flags. This way, users know which options relate to the AI’s behavior vs the CLI’s output. As a design guideline, prefer to not mix the two types in one flag. Concretely: if the user wants JSON output, one approach is `--output=json` which signals the CLI to format the LLM’s answer as JSON (or to prompt the model accordingly). This is clear and mechanical. Don’t rely on users to craft a prompt like “give answer in JSON” every time; the flag is a convenience. On the flip side, a flag like `--temperature` is clearly for AI generation and should not be conflated with, say, an output prettifying option.

* **Flag Syntax and Short vs Long:** Provide long flag names for clarity and, where useful, single-letter short flags for brevity. Use short flags sparingly for the most common options to avoid running out of meaningful letters. For example, `-m` for `--model` could be convenient as users might switch models often. `-t` for `--temperature` is plausible (though `-t` might also mean `--type` in other contexts, so be mindful of overlap). Avoid single-letter flags for things that aren’t frequently used. Always include the full word variant (like `--temperature`) for scripts and clarity. Consistency matters: if one command uses `-o/--output` to select format, all commands that output data should use the same flag name.

* **No Interactivity Required for Flags:** A CLI should never require an interactive prompt for missing info if it can be provided as a flag or argument. If `magellai ask` needs an API key and none is set, it should error with a message like “API key not set. Please configure it via `magellai config set api_key …` or set the MAGELLAI\_API\_KEY env variable,” rather than opening an interactive prompt in the middle of a pipeline. This makes the tool scriptable and predictable. For initial config, a separate `magellai config wizard` command could run an interactive setup, but core commands should rely on flags/config files/env vars, not interactive queries.

* **Combining Flags with Attachments and Piped Input:** Consider how flags interact with piped input or attachments. E.g., if a user does `cat file | magellai ask "summarize"`, this likely means the content of `file` is piped into `magellai`’s STDIN. The CLI design could treat piped STDIN as an implicit attachment or part of the prompt. A typical convention is: if data is piped and you also provide a prompt argument, perhaps `magellai` appends the piped text after the prompt or uses a placeholder in the prompt (some tools use `{}` in the prompt to indicate where piped input goes, but that might be overkill). A simpler approach: if `-a/--attach` is not used but STDIN is not a TTY, assume the entire piped content is to be used as additional context (for instance, prefix the user’s question with “Context from input:\n<content>”). Make sure this behavior is documented so it’s not surprising. Many UNIX tools read STDIN by default if no filename is given, following the philosophy of simple parts working together, and they often use `-` to explicitly denote STDIN as a filename. `magellai` could similarly accept `-a -` to attach stdin explicitly.

* **Profiles and Defaults:** Users will appreciate if they can set defaults for these flags (via config file or environment). For runtime flags like default model, temperature, etc., allow configuring them in `magellai config`. This way, a user who primarily uses one model at a certain temperature doesn’t need to supply those flags each time. At runtime, a flag should override the config. For example, if config has `model = gpt-4`, but the user runs `magellai ask --model=gpt-3.5 ...`, it should use 3.5 for that invocation only. Tools like Open Interpreter store a default profile in a YAML that can be edited for settings, which is a practice `magellai` can emulate (perhaps storing config in `~/.magellai/config.yaml`). This ties into **config management commands** (`magellai config set/get` etc.) which should be straightforward and clearly documented.

* **Output Format Options:** Providing structured output options is increasingly seen as a best practice in CLI design. Many tools allow `--output json` or similar, to facilitate scripting and data exchange without scraping text. `magellai` by default outputs human-friendly text/Markdown, but offering `--output=json` (or `-o json`) could mean the final answer (and possibly some metadata) is delivered as JSON. This is useful if someone wants to pipe the result to `jq` or another program. If implementing JSON output, adhere to some consistency (e.g., define a schema or at least stable structure for the JSON). For instance, JSON output might include fields like `answer` (the text answer) and maybe `sources` or `steps` if the agent provided them. Similarly, `--output=markdown` could ensure that any non-Markdown content is appropriately escaped or formatted. The idea is to give the user control over format without relying solely on the LLM (because while you can prompt an LLM "give me JSON", a robust CLI might post-process to ensure valid JSON).

In designing all these options, remember that **clarity beats cleverness**. It’s better to have a slightly verbose flag name that users immediately understand, than a short or magic flag that is obscure. Document flags thoroughly in `--help` and keep the **most commonly used flags prominent** (e.g., list them first in help output). For example, the help for `magellai ask` might first list `-m/--model`, `-a/--attach`, `-o/--output`, since those are commonly used, and list less common ones like `--temperature` later. This way, new users aren’t overwhelmed by a huge list, and experienced users can still find all options.

## Plugin and Extension Architecture

One of `magellai`’s goals is extensibility – supporting plugins or extensions that add new tools, agents, or workflows. Designing a plugin system means deciding how external code or commands are integrated and discovered by the CLI. Drawing inspiration from other CLI ecosystems:

* **External Command Plugins:** As described, Git and kubectl both use the **executable naming convention** approach. This is simple and language-agnostic: any program following the name pattern can be invoked. `magellai` could implement a similar mechanism: e.g., if an executable named `magellai-tool-xyz` is on the PATH, `magellai tool xyz` could delegate to it. In practice, the `magellai` binary would parse the first subcommand (`tool` in this case), then second-level subcommand (`xyz`) and attempt to find a `magellai-tool-xyz` to exec. This approach allows plugins to be written in any language. Kubectl even provides a `kubectl plugin list` command that scans the PATH for `kubectl-*` files – `magellai` might provide a similar `magellai plugin list` to list installed extensions. Security and naming conflicts are considerations (kubectl, for instance, warns if a plugin name conflicts with a built-in command). `magellai` should define a clear namespace for plugins (perhaps prefixing with `magellai-` and maybe category, like `magellai-tool-`, `magellai-agent-`).

* **Internal Module Plugins:** Another model is to allow dynamic loading of code modules. For example, Azure CLI’s extensions are Python packages that hook into the CLI’s command definitions. Users install them via an `az extension add` command, and the CLI loads them at runtime to augment its command tree. This ensures a seamless user experience (the commands just appear as if native). If `magellai` is implemented in a high-level language, a similar strategy could be to let users install Python packages or Node modules that register new flows/agents. The CLI could have a `magellai extension install <name>` that fetches a plugin (perhaps from a Git repo or package registry). This is more complex to implement than the simple exec approach, but can offer tighter integration (e.g. access to internal APIs, shared config, etc.). **GitHub CLI (gh)** chooses an interesting hybrid: its extensions can be any executable script, but they are distributed as GitHub repos that you install via `gh extension install owner/repo`. This gives ease of installation plus language flexibility. `magellai` could likewise maintain a index of official or community extensions (similar to Kubernetes’ Krew index for kubectl plugins).

* **Tools, Agents, and Flows as Plugins:** The CLI structure suggests different categories of extensions:

  * *Tools*: likely individual capabilities (like a calculator, web searcher, code runner). These could be plugins that `magellai` calls internally when the LLM agent invokes them, but from the user’s perspective, `magellai tool <name>` might also directly execute a tool. Consider allowing a plugin to register both an **agent-facing interface** (for LLM to call during a chain-of-thought) and a **CLI-facing command**. For instance, a “calculator” tool plugin might expose a CLI command for direct use (`magellai tool calculator 2+2`) as well as an API for the LLM agent to use when needed (if the agent is allowed to use tools in a conversation). A robust design might separate these concerns, but naming can be unified.
  * *Agents*: These might be more autonomous or complex behaviors (like the `researcher` that does multi-step web queries). An agent might involve a predefined prompt strategy or a mini state machine. As plugins, they could be distributed as Python scripts or workflows that `magellai` can run. `magellai agent researcher` could load an agent definition (maybe a class or script) and execute it. The plugin might specify metadata like which model to use, any special system prompt, and which tools it can use.
  * *Flows*: A flow sounds like a scripted sequence or workflow, possibly combining multiple steps or agents/tools. For example, a `deep-research` flow might orchestrate: *take user query -> generate search terms -> search web -> summarize findings -> return report.* These flows could be defined in a configuration file (YAML/JSON) or code. In either case, treating them as plugins means users can drop in new flow definitions. `magellai flow <name>` would look up a flow by that name, either built-in or installed, and run it. One approach is to have a `flows/` directory where each flow has a definition file. Another is a more code-driven approach like writing a Python function. The design choice depends on how technical the end user is expected to be when creating flows.

* **Isolation and Security:** Allowing plugins means arbitrary code might run. Both kubectl and gh have fairly open plugin models (they just execute things on your system), so the onus is on the user to only install trusted plugins. For `magellai`, especially if agents can execute system commands or tools, security is a consideration. Each plugin’s capabilities should be clear. For instance, if an agent plugin will have the AI controlling your web browser or file system, a user should knowingly enable it. Perhaps `magellai` can list what permissions or actions a plugin may perform (similar to how browser extensions list permissions). This might be beyond CLI design and more about user trust, but mentioning it in docs is wise.

* **Consistency in Extensibility:** However plugins are implemented, try to provide a **unified user experience** for managing them. E.g., have commands like `magellai plugin install <src>`, `magellai plugin list`, `magellai plugin update`, etc., unless using a completely implicit approach (like dropping executables in PATH). If using the executable approach without a manager, you might still document that “to install a plugin, place its executable in your PATH.” Alternatively, maintain a directory `~/.magellai/plugins` where users can put executables or scripts, and have `magellai` include that in its search. This way users can install without polluting global PATH, and maybe even enable/disable plugins by moving files.

* **Versioning and Compatibility:** When the core CLI evolves, ensure there’s a way to handle plugin compatibility. For instance, if internal APIs or agent interface change, plugin authors should be able to specify a required version or `magellai` might warn if a plugin is outdated. Azure CLI handles this by decoupling extensions (they pin to certain core versions or use a compatibility layer). Simpler exec-based plugins (Git style) are less affected by core version except if CLI arguments/outputs change.

By designing a solid extension mechanism, `magellai` can grow beyond its initial features, and users can tailor it to their needs. Leveraging proven patterns – like naming conventions and centralized indexes (Krew for kubectl, GitHub repos for gh CLI) – will jumpstart an ecosystem of tools, agents, and flows contributed by the community. Just as importantly, document how to build an extension (perhaps provide a template or scaffold command, e.g., `magellai tool create <name>` that generates a stub plugin) to lower the barrier for development.

## Consistent Syntax and UX Patterns

Bringing together all these elements, `magellai` should present a cohesive and intuitive experience. Consistency in syntax and design across commands ensures that once users learn one part of the tool, they can apply that knowledge elsewhere. Here are key consistency considerations:

* **Naming Conventions:** Use a uniform style for command names and flags. If using multi-word commands or flags, decide on hyphenation vs concatenation (e.g., prefer `--max-tokens` instead of `--maxtokens` for readability). Ensure subcommands are either all singular or plural consistently (e.g., don’t mix `tool` with a hypothetical `agents` – pick one style, likely singular nouns). Consistency also applies to how commands are phrased: if top-level commands are mostly verbs (`ask`, `chat`, maybe `configure`), stick to that, or if they’re conceptual nouns (`tool`, `agent`, `flow`), use nouns across the board. In `magellai`’s design it looks like a mix (some verbs, some nouns). This is okay if verbs denote primary actions and nouns denote categories, but then be consistent in documentation explaining that. You might introduce it as: "*Primary commands*: `ask` (ask one question), `chat` (interactive mode). *Management commands*: `config`, `history`. *Extension commands*: grouped under `tool/agent/flow` namespaces." Making these groupings clear helps users mentally model the CLI.

* **Command Syntax Patterns:** Aim for similar syntax structure across comparable commands. If `magellai tool X` executes a specific tool and maybe takes its own arguments, and `magellai agent Y` does similarly, those should behave analogously. For example, possibly both could share the `-a/--attach` and `-o/--output` flags if applicable. If some flows or agents do not support attachments, that flag should either be consistently accepted but ignored with a warning, or not accepted at all; in either case, document it. Additionally, consider whether commands like `tool`, `agent`, `flow` should also have their own subcommands for management: e.g. `magellai tool list`, `magellai tool install <plugin>`, etc. If yes, then the design pattern could be each of those is a group that has subcommands (like `magellai tool run <name>` might be distinct from `magellai tool install`). If no, and they directly dispatch to a specific extension when a name is given, then perhaps any reserved words should be avoided (for instance, if you have an agent actually named “list”, that could clash with a management command name). These edge cases should be resolved in the design (one approach is to require something like `magellai agent --list` with a flag, to not conflict with an agent named 'list').

* **Sessions and History:** Provide a consistent way to handle sessions. If conversations can be saved and resumed, the interface for that (whether `magellai history` or `magellai chat --resume`) should be intuitive. A command like `magellai history` might show an index of recent sessions (with timestamps or titles if the user provided one). Continuing a session could be `magellai chat --resume 3` (using an ID from history). Within a REPL, a command `/save` might save the session transcript, or perhaps it’s auto-saved. Keep the metaphor clear: is it “history” (like a log of everything) or “sessions” (distinct named conversations)? Possibly rename `magellai history` to `magellai sessions` if the focus is on conversation sessions. If additionally you want to keep a history of all one-shot queries (like a log), differentiate that as well. The key is that the user should not be confused about what history they are accessing. Open Interpreter, for instance, automatically stores conversations and provides a selector interface to resume them – `magellai` can adopt something similar, but it should be documented under a clear command.

* **Attachments Usage:** The `-a/--attach` flag (or multiple attachments) should work uniformly across commands that accept input files. If `ask` supports `-a`, likely `chat` could support it too for an initial prompt context (e.g., `magellai chat -a file1.txt -a file2.png` might start a session and immediately provide those files' content to the AI). Similarly, if flows or agents need files, they should use the same flag. Internally, each plugin or flow can interpret attachments as needed (text files read into prompt, images perhaps passed to an OCR or vision tool, etc.), but from the UX perspective it’s the same action: “attach these files.” This prevents a user from having to remember different flags for different subcommands (e.g., `--file` for one and `--attach` for another would be annoying). Consistency here also implies clear documentation on how attachments are used. Perhaps when listing a tool or agent (via a help or `magellai tool info <name>` command), it can specify “Attachments: expects an image file as input” so the user knows what to attach.

* **Output Consistency:** Standardize the default output format and any headers/footers. For example, does `magellai ask` print just the raw answer, or does it include a prefix like “Answer:” or metadata? For scripting, likely the raw answer is best (or controllable via `--output`). Similarly, in chat REPL, you might prefix AI responses with a name or not? Many chat UIs do (“AI: ...”, “User: ...”), but since it’s a REPL with presumably only the user and AI, you could differentiate by color or a simple prompt symbol (like `>>>` for user input, nothing for AI response except a new line). If you do use prefixes or identifiers in interactive mode, consider turning them off for non-interactive output. The user should not get extra verbiage in a pipeline scenario. One approach is to detect if stdout is a terminal; if not, output could be made quieter (no ANSI colors, no interactive embellishments). This way `magellai ask "Q"` in a script returns clean text with no color codes or prompts.

* **Cross-Platform Considerations:** Since Windows (PowerShell) is supported, ensure things like quotes, flags, and pipes are well documented for that environment. PowerShell uses backticks for escaping and has its own notions of pipelines (with objects). However, `magellai` as a program will likely just see text in and text out. Provide examples in docs for Windows usage (e.g. `Get-Content file.txt | magellai ask "..."` as the PowerShell equivalent of `cat file.txt | magellai ask ...`). Also, on Windows, the `MAGELLAI_CONFIG_DIR` or similar might differ (use `%APPDATA%` perhaps). Being consistent includes platform-specific consistency.

* **Example-Driven Consistency:** It can help to create a matrix of example invocations covering all combinations of features and ensure they make sense. For example:

  * Plain question: `magellai ask "Explain quantum computing."`
  * Piped context: `type notes.txt | magellai ask "Summarize the following notes."` (PowerShell `type` example)
  * Multiple attachments: `magellai ask -a intro.txt -a chapter.pdf "Summarize the text and PDF."`
  * Different output: `magellai ask --model=gpt-4 --temperature=0.7 --output=json "Tell a joke."`
  * Using a tool directly: `magellai tool calculator "sqrt(16) + 5"`
  * Running a flow: `magellai flow deep-research "impact of AI on climate" --output=markdown`
  * Starting chat: `magellai chat --model=claude-v2`
  * Inside chat: demonstrating a special command like typing `%undo` to undo last question (assuming that’s implemented similarly to Open Interpreter).

  By designing these examples, you can verify the CLI syntax stays logical across different use cases. They also become great documentation snippets.

Finally, maintain UX consistency in messages and style. If the CLI prints logs or warnings (especially with verbose mode on), use a uniform format (perhaps timestamps or a `[WARN]` prefix, etc.). If using streaming, decide on how to indicate the stream is complete (maybe a newline or a prompt symbol reappears). Little touches like these, when consistent, make the tool feel professional and predictable.

## Conclusion

Building `magellai` as a capable CLI + REPL for LLM interactions requires blending traditional CLI best practices with the unique demands of AI workflows. By learning from established tools – the subcommand structures of Git/kubectl, the user-friendly touches of GitHub CLI and Azure CLI, the pipeline ethos of jq and fzf, and the specialized approaches of AI tools like Ollama and Open Interpreter – we can create a command-line experience that is powerful yet approachable. Key recommendations include designing intuitive modes (`ask` vs `chat`), ensuring every feature is discoverable via help or completion, separating concerns in flag design, enabling extension through plugins, and enforcing consistency at every level of interaction. The end result should be a CLI that feels as natural to use for AI queries as `git` does for version control: a Swiss Army knife for developers and researchers to query and converse with AI directly from their terminal, with the reliability and clarity expected of a modern CLI tool.
