# Interface Documentation Analysis

This document analyzes the current state of interface documentation and identifies areas for improvement.

## Overview

Good interface documentation is crucial for developers to understand how to implement and use interfaces correctly. This analysis focuses on:

1. Whether interfaces have clear, descriptive comments
2. Whether individual methods have documentation
3. Whether error conditions and return values are documented
4. Overall documentation quality and completeness

## Analysis by Package

### Command Package

#### `command.Interface` (pkg/command/interface.go)

Current state:
- Interface has a basic description: "Interface defines the main command interface for all commands"
- Methods have one-line comments
- Missing details on expected behavior, error conditions, and use cases

Improvements needed:
- Add detailed description of the interface's role in the command system
- Document parameter expectations for each method
- Document error conditions and return value semantics
- Add examples of typical usage patterns

#### `command.discoverer` (pkg/command/discovery.go)

Current state:
- Interface has minimal description: "discoverer defines the interface for command discovery"
- Methods have minimal comments
- Documentation is unexported like the interface itself

Improvements needed:
- Even for unexported interfaces, add comprehensive documentation
- Explain the purpose of each method in the discovery process
- Document how different discoverer implementations work together

### Domain Package

#### `domain.SessionRepository` (pkg/domain/types.go)

Current state:
- Interface has a basic description: "SessionRepository defines the contract for session persistence"
- Methods have no individual documentation
- Missing error conditions, parameter descriptions, and usage examples

Improvements needed:
- Add comprehensive documentation for the interface
- Document each method, including parameters and return values
- Detail error conditions that implementations should handle
- Explain the relationship to the storage package

#### `domain.ProviderRepository` (pkg/domain/types.go)

Current state:
- Interface has a basic description: "ProviderRepository defines the contract for provider/model configuration"
- Methods have no individual documentation
- Missing error conditions and usage examples

Improvements needed:
- Add detailed description of the repository's purpose
- Document each method's parameters and return values
- Describe how implementations should handle various scenarios
- Explain the relationship to the LLM package

### Storage Package

#### `storage.Backend` (pkg/storage/backend.go)

Current state:
- Interface has a good description: "Backend defines the interface for session storage implementations"
- Methods have individual comments that are generally informative
- Missing error condition details and implementation guidelines

Improvements needed:
- Add more details about error handling expectations
- Document thread-safety expectations for implementations
- Provide guidelines for implementing the merge and export operations
- Add notes about performance considerations

### LLM Package

#### `llm.Provider` (pkg/llm/provider.go)

Current state:
- Interface has a clear description: "Provider is our adapter interface that wraps go-llms domain.Provider"
- Methods have good one-line comments
- Missing details on error handling, provider options, and implementation guidelines

Improvements needed:
- Add more context about how this interface relates to go-llms
- Document error conditions for each method
- Explain how provider options affect behavior
- Add examples of typical usage patterns

#### `llm.DomainProvider` (pkg/llm/domain_provider.go)

Current state:
- Interface has a good description: "DomainProvider extends Provider with domain type support"
- Methods have basic comments
- Missing details on how it relates to the base Provider interface

Improvements needed:
- Add more details about the relationship to the base Provider
- Document specific error handling for domain-specific methods
- Explain when to use this interface versus the base Provider
- Document any additional behaviors specific to domain operations

## Recommended Documentation Template

For each interface, the following documentation template is recommended:

```go
// InterfaceName represents a [concise description of purpose].
//
// It is responsible for [key responsibilities] and is used in [typical usage contexts].
// Implementations should [implementation guidelines/requirements].
//
// Thread-safety: [thread-safety requirements]
// Error handling: [general error handling guidelines]
//
// Example:
//    [code example of typical usage]
type InterfaceName interface {
    // MethodName performs [description of what the method does].
    //
    // Parameters:
    //   - param1: [description of parameter]
    //   - param2: [description of parameter]
    //
    // Returns:
    //   - [description of first return value]
    //   - error: [error conditions, nil if successful]
    MethodName(param1 Type1, param2 Type2) (ReturnType, error)
    
    // Additional methods...
}
```

## Implementation Plan

1. Start with the most critical interfaces: `command.Interface` and `storage.Backend`
2. Document from the most specific to the most general interfaces
3. Update one interface at a time to ensure consistency
4. Validate documentation with tests and examples
5. Add examples where appropriate to illustrate usage patterns
