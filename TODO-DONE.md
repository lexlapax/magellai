### 4.9 Code abstraction and redundancy checks

#### 4.9.1 Type Consolidation and Abstraction Issues ✅ (Completed)
  - [x] Resolve duplicate Message type definitions across packages:
    - [x] Consolidate pkg/domain/message.go, pkg/llm/types.go, and go-llms message types
    - [x] Decide on single source of truth (domain types recommended)
    - [x] Remove redundant Message definitions and update all references
    - [x] Updated pkg/llm to use domain.Message throughout
    - [x] Created comprehensive adapter functions in pkg/llm/adapters.go
    - [x] Updated pkg/llm/provider.go to use domain types
    - [x] Updated pkg/repl/conversation.go to use domain types directly (no more conversions)
    - [x] Fixed all compilation errors and tests
  - [x] Resolve MessageRole vs Role type inconsistency:
    - [x] Use domain.MessageRole consistently throughout codebase
    - [x] Add conversion for go-llms Role type (includes "tool" role) in adapters.go
  - [x] Unify Attachment type representations:
    - [x] Consolidated to use domain.Attachment throughout codebase
    - [x] Created adapter functions to convert between domain and go-llms types
    - [x] Fixed attachment type inconsistencies in tests
  - [x] Remove pkg/repl/types.go:
    - [x] Removed type aliases that were pointing to domain types
    - [x] Updated all files in repl package to use domain types directly
    - [x] Fixed all test files to use domain types
    - [x] All tests passing after migration
  - [x] Analyze pkg/llm/types.go:
    - [x] Determined that LLM types should remain as technical adapter types
    - [x] These serve different purpose than domain types (API integration vs business model)
    - [x] Keeping separation maintains proper architectural boundaries

#### 4.9.2 Duplicate Conversion Functions ✅ (Completed)
  - [x] Consolidate adapter/conversion functions:
    - [x] No duplicate conversions found - pkg/repl/llm_adapter.go doesn't exist
    - [x] All LLM conversions already centralized in pkg/llm/adapters.go
    - [x] Removed redundant storage conversion layer (StorageSession)
    - [x] Determined no need for a single conversion package
  - [x] Remove unused domain integration helpers:
    - [x] Audited pkg/llm/domain_integration.go - all functions unused
    - [x] Removed entire domain_integration.go file
    - [x] Documented that conversions are properly separated by purpose
  - [x] Find and eliminate duplicate conversion functions between packages
    - Searched for duplicate conversions across codebase
    - Found and analyzed conversion functions in multiple packages
  - [x] Identified unused domain_integration.go file
    - All functions in pkg/llm/domain_integration.go were unused
    - No references found across the codebase  
    - Deleted the file entirely
  - [x] Discovered redundant StorageSession type in pkg/storage/types.go
    - Found that StorageSession was creating duplicate JSON data
    - Direct domain.Session serialization was more efficient (566 bytes vs 836 bytes)
    - Updated filesystem backend to use domain types directly
    - Deleted pkg/storage/types.go as unnecessary
  - [x] Build and all tests still passing after cleanup
  - Result: Eliminated two files containing duplicate conversion logic
  - Impact: Reduced code size, improved JSON serialization efficiency, simplified architecture

#### 4.9.3 Package Organization and Structure ✅ (Completed 2025-05-19)
  - [x] Review package boundaries and responsibilities:
    - [x] Created test package for integration tests
    - Added build tags to all integration test files for better separation
    - This prevents integration tests from running with unit tests by default
    - Created new test/integration directory for future comprehensive tests
    
  - [x] Move misplaced functionality:
    - [x] Moved color utilities from pkg/utils/ to pkg/ui/ (actually kept in utils as per architecture)
    - Color utilities properly shared between CLI and REPL as designed
    
  - [x] Organize test structure:
    - [x] Created pkg/test/integration package for test organization
    - [x] Moved integration tests from cmd/magellai/ to pkg/test/integration/
    - Fixed ask_pipeline_test.go to work with current architecture
    - Added build tags to all integration tests for proper separation
    
  - [x] Configuration for different environments:
    - [x] Added build tags to sqlite tests (integrated with existing tags)
    - Modified Makefile to run integration tests with sqlite tag
    - This allows tests to be categorized and run separately based on environment
    
  - [x] Test separation improvements:
    - Added "integration" build tag to all integration tests
    - Added "integration" tag to sqlite tests alongside existing sqlite/db tags
    - Analyzed filesystem tests and deemed them unit tests (no external deps)
    - Updated Makefile targets to include necessary tags
    
  - Result: Better organized test structure with proper separation of unit and integration tests

#### 4.9.4 Error Handling Consistency ✅ (Completed 2025-05-19)

    - [x] Use fmt.Errorf for dynamic errors with context
    - [x] Implemented error wrapping strategy using fmt.Errorf with %w

    - [x] llm/errors.go for LLM-specific errors
    - [x] repl/errors.go for REPL-specific errors
    - [x] config/errors.go for configuration-specific errors
