## Development Guidelines

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests alongside implementation
- Use table-driven tests for comprehensive coverage
- Mock external dependencies (LLM APIs)
- Integration tests for all CLI commands
- E2E tests for critical user journeys
- Performance benchmarks for key operations
- Update Makefile with all test targets

### Code Organization
- Keep packages focused and single-purpose
- Use interfaces for extensibility
- Minimize circular dependencies
- Document all public APIs
- Follow Go best practices and idioms
- Use consistent error handling patterns

### Library-First Approach
- Keep all core logic in the library (`pkg/`)
- Front-ends (CLI/REPL) should only handle I/O and flag parsing
- Ensure library remains flag-free and testable
- Design APIs that can be consumed by multiple front-ends
- Maintain clean separation between library and UI code

### Commit Guidelines
- One feature per commit
- No automatic commits
- No attribution to external entities
- Clear, descriptive commit messages
- Reference issue numbers
- Keep commits atomic and focused

### Review Process
- Self-review before proposing changes
- Run all tests locally
- Update relevant documentation
- Check for breaking changes
- Update CHANGELOG.md
- Consider backward compatibility

### Release Process
- Semantic versioning
- Comprehensive release notes
- Migration guides for breaking changes
- Pre-release testing
- Cross-platform verification
- Documentation updates
